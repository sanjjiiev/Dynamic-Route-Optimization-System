The Dynamic Route Optimization System is a real-time, interactive pathfinding visualization platform designed to simulate intelligent route selection in urban environments. It models a network of over 50 interconnected locations and dynamically computes optimal travel paths, taking into account both normal and traffic-influenced conditions.
🌐 Features

    🔄 Real-Time Pathfinding: Instantly visualize optimal routes as traffic conditions change.

    🧠 Intelligent Algorithms: Utilizes classic and advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s, A*, or custom heuristics to simulate real-world routing decisions.

    🛣️ Dynamic Traffic Simulation: Adjust edge weights to mimic traffic congestion, roadblocks, or construction zones.

    🗺️ 50+ Interconnected Nodes: Represents a simplified urban map with over 50 junctions or locations.

    📊 Interactive Visualization: User-friendly UI to explore path decisions, toggle traffic, and view metrics such as travel time and distance.
