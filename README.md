The Dynamic Route Optimization System is a real-time, interactive pathfinding visualization platform designed to simulate intelligent route selection in urban environments. It models a network of over 50 interconnected locations and dynamically computes optimal travel paths, taking into account both normal and traffic-influenced conditions.
 Features:

     Real-Time Pathfinding: Instantly visualize optimal routes as traffic conditions change.

     Intelligent Algorithms: Utilizes classic and advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s, A*, or custom heuristics to simulate real-world routing decisions.

     Dynamic Traffic Simulation: Adjust edge weights to mimic traffic congestion, roadblocks, or construction zones.

     50+ Interconnected Nodes: Represents a simplified urban map with over 50 junctions or locations.

     Interactive Visualization: User-friendly UI to explore path decisions, toggle traffic, and view metrics such as travel time and distance.
